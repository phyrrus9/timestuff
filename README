Time stuff project.. This is basically just a hobby of mine, and I will update it as I get around to it. This really only includes a few ideas that are not really /required/ for any programming, but make it a lot easier.

Notes:
The easiest way to test time functions (on unix systems) is to run "time ./test" with your function of choice being the only contents of main.

Current ideas:                                                                                                       Version:
Floating point sleep (half second, quarter second, millionth of a second, etc)                                       1.0
